**Systematic Sentinel-2 imagery processing and collaborative image classification for Antarctic research**

The goal of estinel is to process Sentinel-2 imagery in a systematic way, targeting specific locations of interest. This is a project of the Integrated Digital East Antarctica program at the [Australian Antarctic Division](https://www.antarctica.gov.au/).

## Overview

estinel creates a catalog of Sentinel-2 imagery with:

- Original red, green, blue bands
- Multiple "view types" with different color balance stretches
- Complete workflow traceability using the `{targets}` package
- Interactive browser for visualization and classification
- Collaborative rating system for image quality assessment

**Data Pipeline:**
- Sentinel-2 imagery queried from [element84.com](https://element84.com)
- Processed with GDAL and the R `{targets}` package
- Hosted on the [Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre](https://pawsey.org.au/)

## Interactive Browser

**Try it now:** [Catalog Browser](https://projects.pawsey.org.au/estinel/catalog/catalog-browser.html)

The browser provides:

- **Multiple view modes** - Single image, slider comparison, and side-by-side viewing
- **Rating system** - Classify images as Good/OK/Bad with keyboard shortcuts (1/2/3)
- **Collaborative workflow** - Export/import ratings as JSON for team review
- **Smart filtering** - Multi-select filters to view specific rating categories
- **Playback mode** - Automated slideshow with adjustable speed (0.1s to 3s)
- **Location sorting** - View locations by most recent imagery or alphabetically
- **Rate and Next** - Auto-advance to next unrated image for rapid classification

### Quick Start

1. Open the [browser](https://projects.pawsey.org.au/estinel/catalog/catalog-browser.html)
2. Press `?` to see keyboard shortcuts
3. Use `1/2/3` to rate images (Good/OK/Bad)
4. Enable "Rate and Next" for rapid classification
5. Export your ratings and contribute them as issues to this repository

### Contributing Ratings

After rating images:
1. Click the ⭐ star button to open the rating panel
2. Click "Export Ratings" to download your classifications as JSON
3. Share your ratings by [opening an issue](https://github.com/mdsumner/estinel/issues) on this repository

Community ratings can be aggregated and shared via URL import for collaborative classification efforts.

## Documentation

- **[Design Rationale](inst/docs/design-rationale.md)** - Comprehensive documentation of design decisions, alternatives considered, and rationale for the browser and classification system
- **[Browser Source](inst/docs/catalog-browser-with-ratings.html)** - Single-file HTML application (built with Claude AI)
- **[Image Catalog](inst/docs/image-catalog.json)** - Current catalog structure

## Project Status

This is an active research project. The R package structure provides organization, but the primary workflow currently uses `{targets}` for pipeline orchestration. Development continues for a better underlying map index for the catalog.

## Installation

```r
# Not yet on CRAN
