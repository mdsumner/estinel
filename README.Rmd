# estinel

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of estinel is to process Sentinel 2 imagery in a systematic way targeting specific locations of interest. This is a project of the Integrated Digital East Antarctica program at the [Australian Antarctic Division](https://www.antarctica.gov.au/). 

This creates a catalog of imagery with the original red, green, blue bands and "view" types of those stretched with different options. All of the details of the workflow are recorded and traceable using the {targets} package. 

A browser for the imagery is available at https://projects.pawsey.org.au/estinel/catalog/catalog-browser.html

A design document for the browser is kept here: 

https://github.com/mdsumner/estinel/blob/main/inst/docs/design-rationale.md

There is an R package here but it's not used that way for now. Development is continuing for a better underlying map index for this catalog.
